# JavaScript Object Oriented Programming Project

## [Link](https://js-oop-car-list.netlify.app/) to deployed :rocket: website

I recently learnt more about objects and **OOP in JavaScript**😊, so I built this mini project using the concepts. 

I wrote the JavaScript codes using both ES5 constructors and ES6 classes.
For the most parts, the codes are fairly similar,
 the major difference being the `storeToLS` class which 
contains the `static` codes for the local storage functions.

## Some functionalities 😎

- The input fields take in values of the Car *brand name, model and manufacture year*.
All fields must be filled, else an **error** is returned.
- When all fields are filled appropriately, Car details are added and the *clear button* is displayed.
- Each Car details row has a delete functionality *(recycle bin)*, when clicked, the parent row is
 removed from the list and subsequently removed from local storage.
- If all Car details rows are removed, the *clear button* automatically disappearsm
- Also, an added feature, there is a preloader for period of sluggish network 😁
